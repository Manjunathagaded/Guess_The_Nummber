# Guess_The_Nummber
A simple JavaScript game where the user guesses a randomly generated number between 1 and 100.  Provides real-time feedback (too high, too low, correct) with input validation and attempt tracking.  Great for practicing basic JavaScript concepts like loops, conditionals, user input, and random numbers.
